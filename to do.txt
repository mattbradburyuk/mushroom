to do

- make the deployed track more than one deployment of the contract
- make the compiler compile and link multi class and library contracts

- add cl tool

- make unlock account work for all account not just mine, ie sort out password

- modify to produce compiled output that a can be deployed by a contract

- need to change prescription javascript to use new format complied files (json structure changed to support multiple .sols)

- get multi deployment working

- add usage if cli errors

- improve deployed_instances mechanism

- do read me

- add a wrapper for contract

- make deployer not re deploy if already deployed on chain

- make set up script callable from anywhere

notes:

truffle probably uses a contract on the chain to track deployments because then it has a record of what's been deployed on that specific chain, if it stores the info locally then it might be deploying to a different chain

note on directories

- Contract builder: has the messing about stuff
- Mushromm has the code for copying into a new clean mushroom with the script
- Test_mushroom is a test of the code copying over
