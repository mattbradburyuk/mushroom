to do

- make the deployed track more than one deployment of the contract
- make the compiler compile and link multi class and library contracts

- add cl tool

- make unlock account work for all account not just mine, ie sort out password

- modify to produce compiled output that a can be deployed by a contract

- need to change prescription javascript to use new format complied files (json structure changed to support multiple .sols)

- get multi deployment working

- add usage if cli errors

- improve deployed_instances mechanism

- do read me

- add a wrapper for contract



notes:

truffle probably uses a contract on the chain to track deployments because then it has a record of what's been deployed on that specific chain, if it stores the info locally then it might be deploying to a different chain
